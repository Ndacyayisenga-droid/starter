# Minimal Development guide

## Run locally

To run the website locally, you need to have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed.

Read more about it on the [Jekyll-theme-jakarta-ee](https://jakartaee.github.io/jekyll-theme-jakarta-ee/) pages.

Then, run the following commands:

```shell
# Once only to install dependencies
bundle install
```

```shell
# Every time you want to run the website locally
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
